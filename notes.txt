Makerspace calendar todo:

DONE-see if I can prevent the user from selecting more than one timeslot by dragging.
-show existing time slots that are already taken
DONE-Prevent user from booking timeslots that are already taken. Can I limit a block to having only one event?
DONE (so far) Only allow the user to edit their time slot. Show it in a different color.
DONE-can timeslots start 5 mins after the hour?

When do I do the database insert? Instantly?

Database insert:

DONE-check that the entry doesn't overlap any existing entries
DONE-time must be in the future and less than a week from now
DONE-Insert the new entry
DONE-reload the calendar JSON data


Next steps:

DONE-Add color field to the resource editor
DONE-Add dropdown to select the resource
DONE-Write CFM to fetch calendar events from the DB and output ajax

DONE  getBookings should only fetch bookings for the selected system. Make it go.

Use case 1: Staff Use


Use case 2: Customer use from public website

	-User comes. Enters in card number.
	-If it's not cool error appears. Otherwise:
		Next field appears for system to book.
		View of all bookings for the week appears.
	-Select a resource
	-click on a time slot. Time is booked. Confirmation message appears.
		-If another time slot is clicked for this user, the original will be changed. User will be warned that the original will be moved.

Next step:
	-Confirm that card number has been entered and that it is valid.

DONE If you click another time slot (and your other booking hasn't happened yet), it'll change.
DONE If the prior booking has already happened, create a new booking and don't touch the prior one.

DONE-darken times in the past

  /**************************************/
 /******      Blocked Time      ********/
/**************************************/

*How does a time being 'blocked' off affect the user experience of an app?

-It shouldn't appear the same as an appointment. Perhaps if only because it's grayed out with black text... or something.

-Blocked Times are specified with a start time and end time. A range of time.
-If day of the week is specified, then it only takes effect on the one day of the week specified.
-If day of the week is not specified, then the time is continuous through the period specified.

If you wanted to block out a certain time for every single day of the week for a period, you'd have to enter it in seven times. Otherwise it would block out the whole time.


Consider the following Scenarios:
-Every single day we are closed from 21:00 to 09:00 the following day. How can I make that a single entry? (and not... 14 entries - two for each day of the week?)

I could do it with... two - One for daily.
How would daily work?
-I think I'd need a special db field to flag "Daily"

Perhaps times and dates should be separate fields in the DB
If continuous, day of week is Null.
If Every day, day of week is null and continuous flag is set?

DONE	Sizing Columns for Resource Type Blocked Time
Ability to toggle view of only gaming/creative types


  /**************************************/
 /****** Remaining Functionality *******/
/**************************************/
-Ask the user to confirm the action when making a booking will cause other bookings to be deleted.
-Offer a way to delete bookings without logging in as a user.

-Setting blocked times on top of existing bookings should cause those bookings to be erased.

Provide a resource multi-select option for creating blocked time that automatically inserts multiple blockedtimes for several resourses


-Prevent users from booking more than two hours on all gaming resources in one day
	-On weekends, there may be different hours (one hour per day)
-Different limits may be applied to the green screen and digital conversion

Simplest solution for dealing with blocked cards:
	-Do not flag "error" for blocked. Set a different flag and display a message indicating what cannot be booked.
Test blocked card:
21221020494677

obviate need for 'check' button - can use validation callback

-Column headers in day view

 /******         Name Bug        *******/
/**************************************/

It appears that sometimes, the wrong id is being entered for a user.
This might be because I'm not refreshing the ID field before I pass it somewhere...
let's see if I can figure out which one is correct for the bookings I've got


Examples of incorrect accounts are:

21221022582040	Robert Allan	Dignard -> Samatar Shafi Ahmed
21221023347211	Robert Allan	Dignard 

21221021902959	Thomas Michael	McCallum
21221023327841	Thomas Michael	McCallum -> Trevor J Jordet is BLOCKED.

21221022124587	Eduardo Kempfer	Bastos
21221022977125	Eduardo Kempfer	Bastos -> Conrad Bittern


When selecting Benjamin DLI from the list, it errors and kills itself. Wtf?

 /****** Blocked Time Display Bug ******/
/**************************************/

-Tour with Boys & Girls Club 15:45-18:00 Monday 2014-Jun-02
The issue manifests when there are partially overlapping time slots

-Partial solution is to force the width for BlockedTimes for all resources


  /**************************************/
 /************ Version 1.1 *************/
/**************************************/

-Allow the ability to create and modify resource types
	-Can't delete a type if it is used by a resource
-Set time slot limits on resources and types

-Allow the public to use the booking tool
-Add in lines to delineate columns
-Include a mode to show only certain types/tags
-allow resources to have 'tags' instead of types (or in addition to?)
	-this is an idea that would allow certain groupings of resources

-Create a separate table for past users
-remove the columns for user's first/last name & email from the bookings table
-allow users to be hidden from the prior users list by adding a flag to the users table


-Look into speeding up the loading of events. It's slower than I'd like atm.
-MAYBE Allow for some resources to book more than one slot in the future... (we have an acceptable workaround for this)
