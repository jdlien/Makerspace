BUG: Blocked times show up on single-item view even when they are not applicable to that item

Use a multiselect. Make my display handle a list of resources.


getBookings.cfm needs to support a 'type' parameter.
Also, for some reason, getbookings has the full path hardcoded in 15 times. I'll need to adjust that.

-Labels have to pay attention to the TypeID field.
-All my calculations for columns have to be redone based on TypeID




-When choosing "All Resources" from the dropdown, blocked times don't show for gaming (or anything, maybe?)
-Blocked Times for gaming show for other resources. My guess is that the query I'm running in getBlockedTimes.cfm is flawed somehow.

-I need to figure out a way to calculate number of columns required on the fly in JS based on a list of types.

-Make resource selector a chosen multiselect dropdown


-This chosen multiselect isnt' really going to be the optimal way to interface with this.

Let's convert this into a list of checkboxes with labels.

Gaming[]  Video[]  Creative[]  Digital Conversion []

I'll probably need some javascript to convert the list of checkboxes that have a certain class into a comma separated list or array.
I may consider shortening the labels.


-----------
-Set initial value of checkboxes based on typeID
-Look at handleTypeID

clicking columns books the wrong resources

-Recalculate width of entire page for single-item views.
