Test Plan for Makerspace Booking System New Bookings
====================================================

Adding Bookings
---------------

When adding new bookings for patrons, a number of conditions are checked and a message will be displayed showing either
- A successful booking with the time and resource name
- A failure because of a hard constraint
- A confirmation because a booking was requested under conditions where it wouldn't typically be allowed.

The latest update makes many of the limits on bookings able to be bypassed by confirming that you want a booking to be made regardless of the conditions that would normally not allow a booking. A significant portion of the code relating to this and generating the text in the status "toasts" has been rewritten and should be extensively tested.

The following conditions should be tested, and the expected behaviour is given.

1. Resource booked for a time with no card selected.
	- Error stating that a card number must be chosen before booking

2. Resource booked with the STAFF NOTES account.
	- Booking is successful regardless of how many other bookings this account have or what other resources are booked at that time.
	- Bookings in the past ask for confirmation.
	- Successful bookings are made, along with a message "This booking requires a note.".
	- The Booking Edit dialog pops up

3. Resource made with regular customer card when no other bookings have been made (or no other constraints are present)
	- Booking is successful. A green toast shows the resource and booking time/date.
		Board Room 1 booked
		for 3:05 PM today.

4. Booking a time which has fully elapsed.
	- A warning will show stating that the time is in the past. Clicking yes successfully creates the booking. Clicking No dismisses the toast.

5. A booking is made for a regular customer for a non-concurrently bookable resource when another such resource is already booked for that time.
	- Prompted to cancel the conflicting booking:
		To make this booking, a conflicting booking must be cancelled.
			Board Room 1 at 3:05 PM
			Schedule the new booking?
	- Clicking Yes, cancel deletes the conflicting booking and books the new one.
	- Clicking No just dismisses the toast.

6. Booking is made when a customer has already booked the weekday maximum for that resource.
	- Prompted that the user has already used the maximum allowed bookings and can book resource anyway.
		User has already booked the weekday maximum 2 time slots for the Board Room 1 resource.
		Would you like to book this resource anyway?
	- Clicking "Yes" books the resource.
	- Clicking "No" dismisses the toast.

7. Booking is made when a customer has already booked the weekend maximum for that resource.
	- Prompted that the user has already used the maximum allowed bookings and can book resource anyway.
		User has already booked the weekend maximum 2 time slots for the Board Room 1 resource.
		Would you like to book this resource anyway?
	- Clicking "Yes" books the resource.
	- Clicking "No" dismisses the toast.

7. Booking is made when a customer has already booked the future maximum for that resource.
	- Prompted that the user has already used the maximum allowed future bookings along with a list of those bookings and can book resource anyway.
		Board Room 1 only allows for 3 future bookings.

		The following are already booked:
		Board Room 1 at 3:05 PM today
		Board Room 1 at 3:05 PM Thu, Oct 18
		Board Room 1 at 4:05 PM Thu, Oct 18
	- Clicking "Yes" books the resource.
	- Clicking "No" dismisses the toast.

8. Booking should not be able to be made that overlap with a blocked time or an existing booking. Perhaps a bug can be revealed by making bookings or blocked times that don't take up an entire hour period.
	- If somehow one is able to bypass the front-end interface and request a booking for a time that is already in use, an error should show and a booking should NOT be able to be made.
