- When booking a time that has mostly already elapsed, start the booking at the current time.

- Remove the "note" button"

- Perhaps the gear button needs to be more obviously a button

- When changing a time check:
	- The new time doesn't overlap an existing booking/blocked time
	- the new time is at least 15 minutes
	- The start time is BEFORE the end time
	- 


Edit popup
----------

If time or note have been edited, disable the delete button.

The save changes button will be disabled until a *valid* change has been made.
	- Notes should be okay to have any change
	- Start time must be before end time
	- time does not coincide with other events OR blocked times from the same category.

	If all these things are valid, then I can enable the save changes button. On the action page, I will perform these checks again.


If a time is clicked, but there's already a booking in that hour-slot, create a new booking that is the remainder of the hour.



- Can I make it load a particular date by specifying it in the URL?
- When the date is changed, adjust the URL appropriately
