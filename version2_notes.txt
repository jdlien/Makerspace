Why can't something be added after an element is deleted?

-I could remove the restriction that prevents an event from being booked on an existing event in the first place...

Or I could reload the events after the delete

Is it possible to change the restrictions after a delete? This prevents a full reload of the events which is crappy

This would occur around line 1030
$('.event'+tid).fadeOut(200);
