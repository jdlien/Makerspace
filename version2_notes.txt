Why can't something be added after an element is deleted?

-I could remove the restriction that prevents an event from being booked on an existing event in the first place...

Or I could reload the events after the delete

Is it possible to change the restrictions after a delete? This prevents a full reload of the events which is crappy

This would occur around line 1030
$('.event'+tid).fadeOut(200);

allowedToBook isOverlappingEvent

Need to remove event from $('#calendar').fullCalendar('clientEvents');



Upgrading to Full Calendar 2.4
-Need to remove height attribute from fc-time-grid-container
	Is there a 'proper' way to do this?

Need to recalculate column clicks
(evenWidth()*offset) + (offset*4) - evenWidth() -3;


BIG LIST OF BUGS

DONE 	X and notes are now inside event

In order to get the Delete and Note buttons to 'float off' the button, I have to make overflow visible, but that usually has the side-effects of making other text fall off the event boundaries.

Allow specification of limit to future bookings

let x1 = my age

(x1+(x2-3) = 85

Change extrabookings query to return the number of future bookings of that resource and resource type.

Compare those two numbers with the limits.

Now, when asking to cancel future bookings, the user will have to get a list of the bookings to be cancelled.
